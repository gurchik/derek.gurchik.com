## Hi, I'm Derek Gurchik

I am a software engineer in NYC. I enjoy working on infrastructure automation, developer tools, and helping startups transition to highly available architectures with robust monitoring and incident response. I am currently a DevOps Engineer at [Propel, Inc.](https://www.joinpropel.com/) improving the financial health of low-income Americans. 

Outside of work, I am studying and practicing film photography. I'm inspired by the ability to capture memories without a concern for security updates, manufacturers bricking devices by shutting down a cloud service, and in some cases, without the need for electricity at all. Just a light proof box with some gears and springs and glass and some bottles of development chemistry. You can find some of my work [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/198516755@N05/).
